A basic calculator created with html, css, and javascript.

Notes:
If a user enters a number than clicks the equal sign, error will be displayed. 
Also, an error if a user enters a number an operator and clicks the equal sign 
without entering another number.

Unless you're stringing together many operations, it's best to clear the calculator
after every operation.

Keyboard support and more functions will be added at a later date.
